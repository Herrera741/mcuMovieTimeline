## About The Project

![MCU Movie Timeline App Screenshots](/appScreenshots.PNG)

The Marvel Cinematic Universe currently has many shows and movies out that may be a little hard to keep track of. I developed this app to list the current MCU movies with options to sort by title, year and most importantly, timeline according to the MCU chronology.

Reasons for Creating this App:
* Easy reference for MCU movie timeline
* Wanted to try new SwiftUI framework
* Improve layout skills using stacks in Swift

<!-- BUILT WITH -->
### Built With

* SwiftUI 
* Xcode 12.4
* iOS 14.4


<!-- DEMO EXAMPLE -->
## Demo

Below is a demo of the several sorting options to view the list of movies. Movies can be sorted by timeline according to Marvel Cinematic Universe chronology, release year, or title.
